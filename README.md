# URL Shortner
An URL shortener is a website that reduces the length of your URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that's easier to remember and track.

**ExpressJS Node.js Project with MongoDB and JWT Authentication**

## Overview
This project is a robust URL shortener built with Express.js and Node.js, backed by MongoDB for data storage. The application adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for a clean and organized codebase. User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure access to the shortened URL management features.
